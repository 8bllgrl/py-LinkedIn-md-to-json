How is it accessed?\n\nAnd the answer changed from\n\"from the BIOS\" to\n\"from the computer's startup menu\"\n\nThe phrase \"to adress an issues in UEFI\" could be interpreted as to alter something about the UEFI. For example, a employee at Asus found that in some cases your not able to adjust how much voltage the CPU can get, that employees has now been tasked with addressing this issue.\n\nI changed the answer because you would not access the UEFI from the BIOS. Only in rare cases or manufacturing testing experimental stuff, does a system have both UEFI and BIOS.\n\nTo get to either UEFI or BIOS on a system you usually go via the computer's boot menu or press a certain key to boot straight into that mode.\n```"
